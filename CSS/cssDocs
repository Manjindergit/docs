## Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container. It is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row/column;
  flex-wrap: nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse;
}
```

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 0; //if the container is larger than the items, the items will grow
  flex-shrink: 1; //if the container is smaller than the items, the items will shrink
  flex-basis: auto;
  //They can be combined into the flex property as follows:

  flex: 0 1 auto;
}
```
